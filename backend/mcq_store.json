        "correct_answer": "A/C",
        "explanation": "Tall stature and gynaecomastia are both common clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome. Individuals typically present with tall stature due to delayed epiphyseal closure and may also exhibit gynaecomastia due to hormonal imbalances. Short stature is more characteristic of Turner syndrome, while streak ovaries are specific to Turner syndrome as well. Increased fertility is not a feature of Klinefelter syndrome, as affected individuals often experience hypogonadism and reduced fertility."
