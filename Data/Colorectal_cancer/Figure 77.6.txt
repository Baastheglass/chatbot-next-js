"This diagram shows a virtual colonoscopy of the right side of the colon (part of the large intestine). 

(a) It includes a CT scan (a special type of X-ray) of the belly. In this scan, there is a caecal tumor (a growth in the beginning part of the large intestine) marked by an arrow. 

(b) The second part shows a formatted 'virtual' image of the same tumor from the CT scan. This helps doctors see and understand the tumor better."
