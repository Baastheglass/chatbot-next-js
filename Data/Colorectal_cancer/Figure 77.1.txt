"This diagram shows recommendations for checking on polyps (small growths in the colon) after they have been found. If a person has two or more premalignant polyps (which could become cancerous) and at least one of them is advanced (like a serrated polyp that is bigger than 10 mm or has changes in its cells, or an adenoma that is also bigger than 10 mm or has serious cell changes), or if they have five or more premalignant polyps, they need special follow-up care. This helps doctors keep an eye on any changes that could lead to cancer."
