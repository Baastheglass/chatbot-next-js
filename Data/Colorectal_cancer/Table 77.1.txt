"This diagram shows different types of intestinal polyps. Intestinal polyps are small growths that can form on the lining of the intestines. 

The diagram helps us understand the various kinds of polyps and how they can be classified. 

1. **Adenomatous Polyps**: These are the most common type and can sometimes turn into cancer if not removed.
2. **Hyperplastic Polyps**: These are usually not harmful and rarely turn into cancer.
3. **Sessile Serrated Polyps**: These can also lead to cancer, but they look different from adenomatous polyps.
4. **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**: This is a genetic condition that causes many polyps to form, increasing cancer risk.

Each type of polyp is important to know because some can be more dangerous than others."
