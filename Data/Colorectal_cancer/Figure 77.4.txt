"This diagram shows where colorectal cancer (a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum) occurs in the body. It helps us understand which parts of the colon and rectum are most commonly affected by this cancer. The diagram labels different areas, like the ascending colon (the first part of the colon on the right side), the transverse colon (the middle part that goes across), the descending colon (the part on the left side), and the rectum (the end part of the colon). Each area shows how often cancer is found there."
