"This diagram shows a growth called a pedunculated polyp in the large intestine (the big part of the gut). The polyp has a stalk (like a stem) and is shaped like a mushroom. At the top (apex) of the polyp, there are changes that look like tubulovillous (which means it has both tube-like and finger-like structures). The bottom (base) of the polyp is normal colonic mucosa (the lining of the intestine). This diagram helps us understand what a specific type of polyp looks like and how it can change."
