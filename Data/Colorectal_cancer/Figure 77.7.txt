"This diagram shows a sample of the right side of the colon (the large intestine) that has been removed during surgery. It shows cancer (a disease where cells grow uncontrollably) in the ascending colon (the part of the colon that goes up on the right side of the abdomen). This helps us understand how the cancer looks and where it is located."
