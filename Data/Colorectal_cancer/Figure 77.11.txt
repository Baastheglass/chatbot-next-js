"This diagram shows a CT scan (a special type of X-ray) of the liver. It shows multiple metastases (cancer spots that have spread from another part of the body) from colon carcinoma (cancer that started in the colon, which is part of the large intestine). This helps us understand how the cancer has spread to the liver."
