"This diagram shows a picture of the inside of the colon (the large intestine) in a person with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a genetic condition that causes many adenomatous polyps (small growths that can turn into cancer) to form. In this case, there are hundreds of these polyps, which can lead to serious health problems if not treated."
