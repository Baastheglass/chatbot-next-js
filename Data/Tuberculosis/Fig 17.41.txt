"This diagram shows the tuberculin skin test. This test helps check if someone has been exposed to tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). A small amount of a substance called purified protein derivative (PPD) is placed on the inner surface of the forearm. After a few days, the area is measured. If the bump is 5 millimeters or bigger, the test is considered positive, meaning there might be an infection."
