"This diagram shows a sputum sample (a sample of mucus from the lungs) that has been stained with a special dye called auramine. This dye helps us see Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria that causes tuberculosis) and other similar bacteria. After washing the sample with acid and alcohol, these bacteria keep the dye and glow brightly against a dark background. This makes it easier to spot them under a microscope."
