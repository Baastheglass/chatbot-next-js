"This diagram shows how interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) work. Specifically, it focuses on the QuantiFERON–TB Gold test, which is used to check for tuberculosis (TB). In this test, a sample of blood is mixed with special proteins (antigens) that come from the bacteria that cause TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis or MTB). 

When the blood cells react to these proteins, they release a substance called interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). This is important because it shows that the body is responding to the TB bacteria. The amount of interferon-gamma released is measured using a method called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which helps scientists see how much was produced. 

There is also a similar method called ELISPOT, which stands for enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, that helps count the number of cells making interferon-gamma."
