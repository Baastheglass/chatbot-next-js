"This diagram shows a chest X-ray, which is an image of the inside of the chest. It helps doctors see signs of pulmonary tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). The diagram highlights the main signs of this disease. It also shows less common problems that can happen, like pneumothorax (air leaking into the space around the lungs), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (a serious condition where the lungs can't get enough oxygen), cor pulmonale (a heart problem caused by lung disease), and localized emphysema (damage to the lungs in a specific area). This information helps doctors understand what might be wrong with a patient's lungs."
