"This diagram shows a picture of a lung affected by tuberculosis. In this case, normal lung tissue is damaged and replaced by a lump of fibrous tissue (a thick, scar-like tissue). This lump has granulomatous inflammation, which means there are many immune cells called macrophages (big eaters that help fight infections) and multinucleate giant cells (cells with many nuclei that form when macrophages join together, shown by the white arrow). In the center of this lump, there is a part that has caseous degeneration (a cheesy-looking area that happens when tissue dies), indicated by the black arrow. This helps us understand how tuberculosis can change lung tissue."
