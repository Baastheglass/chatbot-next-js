"This diagram shows how extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) affects parts of the body outside the lungs. It helps us understand the different ways TB can show up in other areas, like the bones, kidneys, or lymph nodes (glands that help fight infection). Each part of the diagram represents a different area where TB can cause problems, helping us see that TB is not just a lung disease but can affect many parts of the body."
