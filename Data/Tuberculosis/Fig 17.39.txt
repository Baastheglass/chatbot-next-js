"This diagram shows a chest X-ray of a person with tuberculosis (a lung infection). It highlights changes in both upper lobes of the lungs. The 'airspace shadowing' means there are areas in the lungs that look cloudy because they are filled with fluid or infection. 'Cavitation' refers to holes or empty spaces in the lung tissue caused by the infection. This diagram helps us understand how tuberculosis can affect the lungs."
