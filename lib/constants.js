Overview:
I want to build an ai-powered SAAS targeted towards businesses that want to understand how ai can help solve the businesses challenges. The SAAS will be in the form of an online browser based application. The aim of the SAAS is simple, it's a tool that businesses owners, directors and managers can use to gain an understanding of the possibilities of ai within their business, and consequently, helping generate leads for stratos ai.

Target market
The target market is business owners. In stratos ai's experience, talking with hundreds of business owners, the key challenge that they face is that they are unaware of the capabilities of ai. During discover calls with these business owners, I showcase to them the power of ai (no code and code tools), and how powerful it really is, and every single call ends in the business owners mind expanding to the possibilities. Some of the features I showcase is how AI admin, voice and chat assistants can be deployed in the business to alleviate bottlenecks, challenges and help the business become more productive.

The rough idea:
The saas will act as a virtual AI consultant, essentially replicating everything that I manually do with businesses - undertaking a discovery, identifying challenges, planning out an AI solution to solve the challenges, and put together a solution architecture for them. The SAAS will guide the business owner through a series of questions which will help in discovering existing challenges/inefficiencies in the business which AI can assist with. Below is an example of what kind of questions will be asked to the business owner:
- What is the name of the company
- What industry is the company in
- Describe the company in one paragraph
- What are the companies core products or services
- What are the companies goals for this year? (operational, revenue)
- What CRM does the company use?
- Are there any other tools that are used? (E.g. Xero for accounting, Slack for communication, etc)
- What are the major challenges in the business that have a digital footprint?
- If you have a magic wand, which top 3 challenges would you want AI to solve?
- Have you used any AI tools before?
There will potentially be more questions that we'll add later, but for now that provides context of what the SAAS is attempting to understand from the customer. Once SAAS has this information, AI will work to form an understanding of the business, it's challenges, softwares used and provide a viable solution. The solution is just an idea for them, and it isn't implemented for them. The purpose of showcasing the solutions is two-fold: one to show them the real power of how ai can help their business, and two for stratos ai to engage the lead via email or call and work to secure the business as a paying client.

The solution would be provided to them on the next web page, and give them a report, alongside a graphic and a voice option where AI assistant explains the solution. A rough example of a solution would be "the challenge that exists in your customer service department of leads not being instantly engaged by the sales team can be solved via AI by deploying an ai voice and chat assistant which operates via a phone call and SMS. As soon as a lead enters into your CRM Monday.com, the AI assistant will recognise this new lead and will first call them to qualify them, and if the lead doesn't answer it'll send them an SMS. The AI assistant will work to qualify the lead via the mentioned communication channels. The status of the lead, all details and conversations transcripts will automatically sync into your CRM monday.com, and appear under the leads contact profile."

Commercials
Stratos ai are creating this SAAS for businesses to use for free, and the intention is that this will be a lead generation tool for stratos ai to acquire new business. When a business owner finishes their assessment (answering all the questions) and gets their solution, the business owner will be provided with a booking link to book a call with me if they want to move forward with exploring the implementation of the AI solution.`;
